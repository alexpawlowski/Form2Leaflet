# Form2Leaflet
Take results from a Google Form to a Leaflet Map. Add functionality for what3words as well.

Inspired by eidam on [coffeegnome.net](http://www.coffeegnome.net/synchronization-of-leaflet-js-and-google-spreadsheet/) with their tutorial on synchronizing google sheets with Leaflet through `[tabletop.js](https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop/)`. Extended with `what3words` API to allow for easy location storage.

# Features
- You supply the id of your google sheet, tabletop does the rest.
